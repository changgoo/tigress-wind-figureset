## Data tables are saved with `ascii.ecsv` format using `astropy.table.QTable`

* `table-mean.ecsv` contains the mean values over $0.5<t/t_{\rm orb}<1.5$ for all quantities presented in Tables 1-4 from all models, phases, and heights.
* `table-mean-err.ecsv` contains the error of the mean using bootstrap resmapling.
* With the data, Figures 8-14 and 19 can be reproduced.
